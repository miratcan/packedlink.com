# The ZEN of PackedLink

This document defines the spirit and philosophy of PackedLink. For technical decisions, see `technical-decisions.md`.

## Focus

**[ZEN-ONE-JOB]** We do one thing well: Turn curated links into organized lists.

**[ZEN-NOT-BOOKMARK]** We're not a bookmark manager. Not "save everything" but "share the selected" tool.

**[ZEN-TOPIC-AGNOSTIC]** Topics don't concern us. From gaming to technology, curation works for everything.

**[ZEN-FLEXIBLE-TAXONOMY]** Tags, not categories. A link can exist in multiple places.

**[ZEN-GLOBAL-FIRST]** We're a global product. Carlos in Miami and Ayşe in Izmir should both be able to use it. Universal needs, not local features.

## Experience

**[ZEN-INSTANT]** See link → Add. Need list → Share. Zero friction.

**[ZEN-PROUD]** Users take pride in their lists. "I curated this" feeling. We provide tools to personalize profiles and own content.

**[ZEN-LIVING-LISTS]** Lists are living documents. Continuously updated, evolving.

## Ownership

**[ZEN-USER-FIRST]** List owner > Visitor. We make the creator's life easier first.

**[ZEN-DATA-FREEDOM]** Data belongs to the user. Export rights are non-negotiable, no lock-in.

## Simplicity

**[ZEN-NOT-SOCIAL]** We're not a social network. No feed, follow, like, comment, or DM.

**[ZEN-ONE-OUTPUT]** Main output: A single guide page. Dashboards and analytics don't disrupt the core experience.

## Working Style

**[ZEN-CORE-FIRST]** First, perfect the core value (create list + share); accessory features come only after this flow is rock solid with real usage data.

**[ZEN-SOLO-FIT]** All plans, implementation, and marketing decisions must be simple and clear enough for a solo founder to execute end-to-end realistically.

**[ZEN-MEASURE-FIRST]** Every critical flow is measured; we don't ship without event data and base decisions on numbers, not feelings.

**[ZEN-EASIEST-PATH]** A feature isn't “done” until the easiest, lowest-friction way to use it is delivered. Default to the shortest path (fewest fields/steps), remember user context, and avoid extra variants that don't reduce friction.

## Honesty

**[ZEN-NO-TRICKS]** No dark patterns. We don't do popups, forced signups, clickbait, or bait-and-switch.

**[ZEN-RESPECT]** We protect the list owner's reputation. We don't spam on their behalf.

## Growth

**[ZEN-ORGANIC]** We prefer word-of-mouth over forced virality.

**[ZEN-SEO-COMPOUND]** SEO is like compound interest. Even if the app launches in 3 months, build the blog system from version one. On launch day, 500 blog posts should be indexed on Google. Viral traffic lasts 1 day, SEO traffic lasts 10 years.

**[ZEN-SAY-NO]** We say "no" to requests that don't align with vision. We resist feature creep.

**[ZEN-BATTLE-READY]** Success is its own DDoS. From day one: scalable architecture, CDN, rate limiting ready.

## Values

**[ZEN-EMPOWER]** We empower content creators, not exploit them.

**[ZEN-FAIR-TRADE]** If we ask for money, we give real value in return.

## Anti-Patterns

❌ **Feature Factory:** New feature every week
❌ **Growth Hacking:** Tactics that trick users
❌ **Platform Risk:** Dependency on single platform
❌ **VC Mindset:** Sacrificing experience for hyper-growth

## Decision Filter

When considering a new feature:

1. Does it make list sharing easier?
2. Does it complicate the product?
3. Is it a social network feature?

2+ "yes" = Don't do it.
