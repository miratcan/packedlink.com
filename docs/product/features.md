# Product Features - PackedLink

This document provides a complete overview of PackedLink's features, organized by availability (Core/Free vs Pro) and explicitly defining what we're NOT building.

## Core Value Proposition

**"Create link lists. Give everyone a single link."**

Turn curated links on a single topic into organized lists and share them anywhere with a permanent URL that updates automatically when you edit.

## Core Features (Free)

### List Creation & Management
- **Create multiple lists** - Organize different topics separately ("Austin Coffee," "Baby Gear," "Frontend Resources")
- **Add links with notes** - Include context for each link (not just a URL)
- **Tag-based organization** - Flexible taxonomy; one link can exist in multiple places
- **Living documents** - Lists update continuously; URL stays the same
- **No friction entry** - See link → Add. Need list → Share. Zero steps in between.

### Sharing & Access
- **Permanent URLs** - Each list gets one URL that never changes, even when updated
- **Public/private control** - Choose who can see your lists

## Viral Mechanisms (Organic Growth)

PackedLink includes subtle, non-intrusive growth features aligned with **[ZEN-ORGANIC]**:

1. **"Make your own list" prompt** - At the end of lists
2. **"Made with PackedLink" watermark** - Subtle branding
3. **Ready-to-share copy** - Easy social distribution
4. **List copy feature** - Users can fork and customize lists

No forced popups, dark patterns, or growth hacks. Word-of-mouth preferred over forced virality.

---

## Roadmap Philosophy

Features are added based on **[ZEN-CORE-FIRST]** and **[ZEN-MEASURE-FIRST]**:

- **Core first:** Perfect "create list + share" flow before adding accessory features
- **Data-driven:** Ship with event tracking; decide based on numbers, not feelings
- **Solo-fit:** Features must be simple enough for a solo founder to execute
- **Say no:** Resist feature creep; align with vision or reject

For specific roadmap items, see [GitHub Milestones](https://github.com/miratcan/packedlink.com/milestones).

## Decision Filter

When considering a new feature:

1. ✅ **Does it make list sharing easier?** → Consider
2. ❌ **Does it complicate the product?** → Reject
3. ❌ **Is it a social network feature?** → Reject

2+ "yes" = Don't do it.
