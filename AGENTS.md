## 🚀 Start Here: 3-Step Onboarding

### Step 1: Understand the Workflow
Read **`docs/development/ai-katki-rehberi.md`** - This is THE definitive 6-step process for every task:
1. Task Understanding
2. Information Gathering and Analysis
3. Planning and Proposal
4. Implementation
5. Validation
6. Review and Handoff

**You must follow this workflow for every task, no exceptions.**

### Step 2: Learn the Product Philosophy
Read **`docs/zen.md`** - ALL 24+ principles that guide every decision:
- ZEN-ONE-JOB, ZEN-NOT-SOCIAL, ZEN-SOLO-FIT, ZEN-MEASURE-FIRST, etc.
- **Validate ALL feature ideas against these principles**
- If a task violates ZEN, speak up

### Step 3: Check Current Goals
Review **[GitHub Milestones](https://github.com/miratcan/packedlink.com/milestones)** - Current phase objectives and acceptance criteria

## 📚 Reference Documentation

**For complete documentation index:** `docs/README.md`

**Key references you'll need during Step 2 (Information Gathering):**
- **Product:** `docs/vision.md`, `docs/product/features.md`, `docs/product/personas.md`
- **Technical:** `docs/technical/tech-stack.md`, `docs/technical/technical-decisions.md`
- **Development:** `docs/development/github-workflow.md`, `docs/development/css-guide.md`

The `ai-katki-rehberi.md` workflow tells you exactly which docs to read for each type of task.

## ⚠️ Critical Rules

1. **Follow the 6-step workflow** in `ai-katki-rehberi.md` for every task
2. **Read full documentation files** - Don't assume from partial reading
3. **Keep docs/ minimal** - Implementation details go in issue comments, NOT docs/
   - Read "Keep docs/ Minimal" rules in `docs/README.md`
4. **Validate against ZEN principles** - Every feature, every decision
5. **Don't commit code** without explicit user request
6. **Use GitHub workflow standards** - See `docs/development/github-workflow.md`
