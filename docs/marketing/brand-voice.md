# PackedLink – Brand Voice, Character, and Positioning

This document establishes the **language, tone, and feel** for PackedLink. Landing pages, in-product copy, emails, and social media should follow this framework.

---

## 1. Product Definition and Category

**Product name:** PackedLink
**Category:** Link list tool

**Core description (short):**
PackedLink helps you pack your frequently used links into one list and present them to others with a single address.

**Tagline (fixed):**

> **Pack your links. Share anywhere.**

This tagline can be used as the main statement on landing hero, social media bios, and presentation covers.

---

## 2. Target Users (Summary)

PackedLink solves problems for three main groups:

1. **Content Creators**
   People creating content on YouTube, Instagram, TikTok who want to "show many things with one link" in video descriptions and bio areas.

2. **Place and Guide Sharers**
   People preparing city guides, breakfast lists, "places to send friends visiting Austin" who want to share everything from one page.

3. **Team Link Sharers**
   People repeatedly asked for document, form, and tool links within work, projects, and teams who want to gather them all on one page.

---

## 3. Brand Character (3 Words)

If we think of PackedLink as a person, we'd describe it like this:

1. **Calm**
   Doesn't shout. No hype. Says "Here's how it works," shows, and steps aside.

2. **Honest**
   Clearly states what it collects and doesn't. No fine print games. Doesn't exaggerate positives.

3. **Small but serious**
   No claim to save the world. Wants to solve one problem well: make links organized and shareable.

All copy should not contradict these three characteristics.

## 4. Tone and Language Rules

PackedLink's English language stays on this line:

1. **Use "you" language.**

   * Right: "You're packing your links in one place."
   * Wrong: "Users pack their links in one place."

2. **Short and clear sentences.**

   * Avoid long, comma-heavy, academic sentences.
   * Carry one idea per sentence.

3. **No marketing fluff.**

   * Avoid: "unique experience," "game-changing," "gives you incredible power."
   * Use: "Helps you keep your links in one place."

4. **Casual but not frivolous language.**

   * Can be slightly conversational but not exaggerated.
   * No excessive emoji, memes, or over-familiarity.

5. **Minimal technical terms.**

   * If concepts like "link in bio tool" are needed, explain them.
   * Don't highlight English terms like "analytics, monetization" in product.

6. **Emphasis on transparency.**

   * Be clear about privacy and control.
   * Don't hesitate to make "We never do this" statements.

## 5. Value Proposition (Why PackedLink?)

Three core promises that can be repeated on landing and product explanation:

1. **Pack your links together.**
   You're packing your frequently used links on one page. You can add short notes if you want.

2. **Share one address.**
   You're sharing the same address to bio, story, group. People see all links on that screen.

3. **Don't keep it in your head.**
   You're not thinking "Where was that link?" You open the page, copy the link, continue.

This trio can be used both in the "Why PackedLink?" section on landing and in product onboarding flow.

---

## 6. "Who Uses It?" Blocks

Short persona blocks that can be used on landing page:

### 6.1. Content Creators

> You're creating content on YouTube, Instagram, TikTok. You're giving one link for your videos, products, courses. People find whatever they're looking for on that page.

### 6.2. Place and Guide Sharers

> You're preparing city guides, breakfast lists, "places to send friends visiting Austin." You're packing everything on one page, sharing the link with the group.

### 6.3. Team Link Sharers

> Team document, form, and tool links are always asked of you. You're making a list, giving everyone the same address.

These texts can be shortened as needed, but tone and content should be preserved.

---

## 7. Ethics and Privacy Stance

This section can appear as a small block on landing.

**Suggested title:**
**What PackedLink doesn't do?**

Three points:

1. **Doesn't put you in a tracking trap.**
   Doesn't get into tricks like "Let's convert your followers to email list, add pixels."

2. **Doesn't sell or rent your data.**
   Doesn't use your links for ad targeting. Your lists are yours, we just store them.

3. **You leave when you want.**
   You export your lists, close your account. We try not to leave data behind.

This block is an important area showing PackedLink's difference from big platforms.

## 8. Visual Direction

For visual design rules (color palette, typography, spacing, components) see **[docs/product/design-guide.md](../product/design-guide.md)**.

## 9. Example Copy

### 9.1. Hero Section (Draft)

Category label:
**Link list tool**

Title:
**Pack your links. Share everywhere.**

Sub-description:
**You're packing your frequently used links on one page. You're sharing the same address to bio, story, group. People see all links on that screen.**

Button text:

* **"Create your list"**
* Secondary button (if any): **"See example list"**

### 9.2. In-Product Example Sentences

* Empty list screen:
  "No links yet. Add your first link to populate the list."

* Link add modal title:
  "Add link to list"

* Successful copy notification:
  "Link copied. You can paste it anywhere."

* Delete confirmation:
  "You want to remove this link from the list. Are you sure?"

All these examples should stay consistent with the tone and character defined above.
